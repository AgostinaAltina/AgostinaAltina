<h2> About Me ðŸ‘© </h2>
<span style="color:#2a2a2a;">I am constantly studying and expanding my knowledge in the Data field. Iâ€™m interested in finding patterns and discoveries that help decision-making. I am passionate about research and analysis, therefore I got caught up in the Data world. I believe that Data is history that shows us information as papers in the past and through Data Analytics we can find the most valuable insights and even use this information to anticipate decisions for the future.
