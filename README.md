ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Agostina Altina, Data Analysis trainee, constantly studying and expanding my knowledge in the Data field. 
   -
   I am looking for my firsts job opportunities to gain experience and to challenge myself to improve.
  
   
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding patterns and discoveries that help decision-making. I am passionate about research and analysis, therefore I got caught up in the Data world.
    I believe that Data is history that shows us information as papers in the past and through Data Analytics we can find the most valuable insights 
    and even use this information to anticipate decisions for the future. 
    
    
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Power BI intermediate, Advanced SQL and practising with proyects these last mentioned tools plus Python and Excel/Google Sheets.
