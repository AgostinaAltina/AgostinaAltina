 ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Welcome!**
   
  
   I am Agostina Altina, Data Analyst | Data Scientist, constantly studying and expanding my knowledge in the Data field. 
   Iâ€™m interested in finding patterns and discoveries that help decision-making. I am passionate about research and analysis, therefore I got caught up in the Data world.
   I believe that Data is history that shows us information as papers in the past and through Data Analytics we can find the most valuable insights 
   and even use this information to anticipate decisions for the future. 
    
   I have intermediate to advanced level of proficiency with **Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI** as well as **Microsoft Office** package and **Google tools**.
   I have excellent **communication** skills making it possible to achieve an effective dynamic transposition to ensure that information is clear and understandable. I am a very **proactive, analytical and dedicated** in what I do.
